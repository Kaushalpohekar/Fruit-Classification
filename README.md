# Fruit-Classification
The main objective of this project is to train a deep neural network that can identify fruits from images. This is part of a more complex project that has the target of obtaining a neural network that can identify a much wider array of objects from images

#Problem Statement
Firstly, this is the topic that is highly neglected, there is no research going on classifying fruit dataset using neural networks. Secondly, the shape and size of the fruits varies a lot which will create some incorrect predictions. And at last, the size of the images is comparatively small in size, which will create some error in prediction of fruits. 

#Applications 
There may be a variety of applications of fruit recognition in agricultural work when we are to recognize thousands of fruit images in a less amount of time. Also it can also be applied in automating the billing process at a fruit shop where the model can recognize the fruit and calculate its price by multiplying with weight. 

#Data Collection 
•	We Collect data from code warrior’s Google drive. We have data in the form of images.
•	Total number of training images is 1212.
•	Total number of testing images is 300.
•	Total classes of fruits 6 fruits.
•	Fruits image size varies up to 64*64 pixels.
•	Data Source:- https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1-wmslgywHYflP6K_BlPE9WIndS1f99Bj?usp=sharing 

Data Analysis
Here we are classifying fruits in different categories like fresh and rotten fruits. We have 3 different kind of fruits like apple, orange and banana. With two classes for each fresh and rotten.

Training purpose images:-

Fruit Name	Images
Fresh Apple	186
Fresh Orange	165
Fresh Banana	175
Rotten Apple	263
Rotten Orange	178
Rotten Banana	245

 
Testing purpose images:-

Fruit Name	Images
Fresh Apple	46
Fresh Orange	41
Fresh Banana	43
Rotten Apple	65
Rotten Orange	44
Rotten Banana	61
